Blog was created the traditional scaffold way (creates controller, model, and views), 
Page was created by just generating a controller (creates a controller and views, but no model which means no DB table or migration), 
Skills was created using just the model generator (creates a model), 
Portfolio was created using the resource generator (creates controller (empty), model (empty), view (but no index pages), and after db:migrate creates the attribuites in the DB)
